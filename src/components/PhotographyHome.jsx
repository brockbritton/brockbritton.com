      <p>
        Welcome! I have been a professional photographer since 2016, specializing in capturing moments through a single frame. My expertise spans various photography styles, with a particular focus on long exposure shots that capture motion blur and light trails, as well as high-speed photography that freezes moments of impact. I am passionate about the challenge of encapsulating time in my images and hope you enjoy exploring my work.
